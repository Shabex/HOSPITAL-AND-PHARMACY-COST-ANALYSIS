# Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hospital and pharmacy costs data. 
The goal is to answer valuable questions and provide insights to various business questions based on the dataset. 
The following README file provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems and insights.

# Dataset
The dataset for this project has been provided by the client, and it consists of a single Ms Excel file with 3 sheets, each sheet containing tables
The tables are the 
- Patients Table with 120 rows and 4 Columns
- Visits Table with 300 rows and 6 Columns
- Pharmacy Transactions Table with 350 rows and 7 Columns

# Business Questions
1. Which diseases are most common across counties?
2. Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?
3. Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?
4. Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?
5. Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

# Insights

- The total number of visits based on our data stands at 300 visits, which translates to the pharmacy revenue of at least Kshs. 275,000, with the highest revenue and visits witnessed in August, with most patients coming in with diabetic and flu-related cases across all the counties. That means the hospital needs to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of diabetes and flu medicines during that period. We can also comfortably say that the higher the number of visits, the higher the pharmacy revenue.
  
- From our dashboard, we also noticed that Flu, followed closely by Typhoid, are the leading diseases across all the counties that are being analysed,  with 56 and 54 cases respectively, an indication that the hospital needs to ensure constant and sufficient supply of flu and Typhoid-related medicines throughout the year.

- The inpatient department record highest number of  pharmacy revenue, which is an indication that most patients coming in are admitted, and hence the hospital and pharmacy need to invest more in setting up inpatient facilities and sufficient medical supplies to take care of the growing number of inpatients.

- In terms of age-group insights,  we can clearly see that adults who are aged between 41 and 69 years and the elderly who are above 69 years are the lead consumers of medication, with female patients for adults and male patients for the elderly being the lead in terms of the quantity of medicines consumed. This can be attributed to lifestyle-related  and chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes. The hospital and pharmacy should focus more on the adult and elderly patients.

- We can also see from our analysis that some diagnoses, such as Flu, are registering longer hospital stays but very low pharmacy spending, which can be due to some patients using medicine from outside pharmacies or being prescribed drugs not captured in the pharmacy billing system, leading to bed blockage to high value cases  and poor resource utilisation. The hospital management should consider introducing early discharge protocols, strengthen outpatient follow-up and consider day-care for mild flu cases.
